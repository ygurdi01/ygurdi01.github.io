My Personal Website for COMP 20

I have used a variety of HTML elements and created several CSS rules to style my content.
On my resume, I had some issues validating the nested lists with W3C.

I spent about 4 hours on this assigment in total.
This included learning about favicons which although creates a suble effect, was really cool to learn and implement.
A good amount of time went into working with the public_html folder and changing rights. 

I had originally uploaded my entire website to the cs server. I then created a completely new index that simply has a link
that redirects to my GitHub website.
